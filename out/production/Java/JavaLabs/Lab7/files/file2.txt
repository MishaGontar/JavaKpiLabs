Ton
Apart from the substance and the argument itself, the tone is the single most important means through which you
establish your credibility. It is through tone that you convey your attitude towards the issue and the audience.
 The tone may be objective, satirical, solemn or angry.
Tone is even more crucial in persuasion than it is in argumentation.  Facts and logic may
be enough to convince one of the validity of an argument, but they do not inevitably move
one to certain action. It is through tone that you make your audience feel that something
is right, not only for you, but also for them.
