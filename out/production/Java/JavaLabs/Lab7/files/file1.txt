Persuasive essays can be organized in a number of different ways, but many writers present their arguments in a logical progression, often in the order of importance, saving the most important point for last.
Examples of emotion and call to action:
Argumentation: Despite the fact that some people find seat belts uncomfortable, statistics show that those who wear them have a greater chance of surviving car crashes than those who do not wear them. Surely, safety is more important than comfort.
Persuasion: Seat belts save lives, and if you had seen, as I have, the hospital wards full of mangled bodies of people who refused to wear them, you also would demand that the government institute seat belt legislation. You can begin now, by signing this petition.
Evaluating A Persuasive Essay
A good persuasive essay appeals to different sides of our brain:
to the left side, which we use for logic, and reasoning,
and to the right side, which we use to feel emotions.
An essay full of facts and statistics may make a logical argument, but without emotional power it is unlikely to convince you of anything.

The first impact of global warming is the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers. So, a loss of habitat for species in the frozen zone is likely.
Losing tonnes of ice could result in the rising of sea levels, and inundation of coastal areas all over the world. Glaciers are the sources of our rivers. With no glaciers, many rivers could dry up, leading to severe water scarcity.
Global warming and erratic changes in climate patterns are closely linked. Frequent droughts, more torrential rainfalls, stronger cyclones are becoming common in various parts of the world. Extreme heatwaves and wildfires are becoming a regular phenomenon.
All these impacts not only our economy but also normal human life. Millions have succumbed to nature's fury and may continue as predicting the climatic conditions is getting complicated.
Global warming impacts food availability too. Many plants cannot withstand severe droughts and floods. Agriculture could become a very costly occupation. New pests and fertilizer resistant insects are evolving as they can tolerate harsher weather.
Livestock is at risk of heat stress and poor quality of food supply. As oceans absorb CO2 emissions, they are getting acidified. Our underwater species are getting wiped out at a fast rate.
