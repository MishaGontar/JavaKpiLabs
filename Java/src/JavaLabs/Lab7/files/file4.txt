Argumentation vs. Persuasion
Argumentation and persuasion are forms of exposition. Argumentation seeks to convince the audience of the case the writer presents. Persuasion goes further still; it seeks to move the audience to take a given action or to adopt a certain idea or attitude.

Less emotion More emotion
Less commitment More commitment
Very little call to action Aggressive call to action
It can be said that complete chaos ensued in our country as a result of the sudden action of the government. Before the 2016 demonetization, India had not embraced cashless digital payment methods, and 78 percent of the transactions were in cash.
All our ATMs had long, snaking lines. Another major problem was the different dimensions of the new notes. Even the thickness of the new currency notes varied and all the ATMs had to be re-calibrated. So, only 60 percent of the ATMs in the country were operational.
To add further to the misery, the government imposed cash withdrawal limits too. One could withdraw only 24000 rupees in a week from a bank and 2500 rupees from an ATM per day. These limits were imposed as the number of new currency notes printed was insufficient. This exposed the lack of proper preparation by the government. The withdrawal restrictions were eased gradually.
For the tech-savvy people, demonetization didn’t have much impact. But, it was the poor and the small businessmen who were affected the most. Business owners could not pay their staff, and daily wage workers had lost their livelihood for a brief period.
For the elderly, waiting outside the banks and ATMs was a herculean task. There are reports that people even collapsed while standing in the queues. People who had planned family functions like marriages and holiday trips, demonetization became an unexpected obstacle.
